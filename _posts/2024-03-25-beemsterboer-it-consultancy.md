Starting April 2, 2024, I will start as a freelance DevOps Consultant.

As a DevOps Consultant, I focus on improving the processes and collaboration of
IT teams involved in software development and operations. I assist organizations
in adopting Continuous Delivery, enabling them to deliver high quality software
with greater efficiency while ensuring engineers enjoy their work more.

Continuous Delivery and DevOps go beyond automation and tool configuration. It
also involves addressing the entire process, from idea, software
development, deployment to production, keeping it running in production,
continuously gathering feedback, to eventually decommissioning the application.
But ultimately, it is primarily a mindset, constantly striving to improve as an
individual, team, and organization, continuously learning and continuously
improving.

Over the past years, I have worked in this role at various organizations. First at
Vivat, a large Dutch insurance company, and later on behalf of Delta-N at companies
such as the CAK, DLL Group, and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). I have thoroughly
enjoyed working at Delta-N for the past 4.5 years and have learned a lot. Now, I
am taking the next step as an independent professional.

Could you use some help with this as well? Feel free to reach out!
