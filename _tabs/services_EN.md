<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
With my experience as a DevOps Consultant, I enjoy helping various organizations
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->
improve their DevOps practices and workflows. Below are some examples of
projects where I can assist your organization.

If you're interested or curious about the possibilities, 
[feel free to contact me](mailto:info@mikebeemsterboer.nl).

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

If your organization is already using Azure DevOps, GitHub, or similar tools,
I can help set up or improve your pipelines.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

I can help set up and write Azure Bicep templates, enabling you to roll out
resources in Azure in an automated and consistent manner.

## Automation (Builds, Deployments, Repetitive Tasks)

If your organization is still performing builds or deployments manually, I
can assist in automating these processes. This also applies to other
repetitive tasks currently done manually.

## Azure DevOps Audit

I can conduct a check of your Azure DevOps environment. Based on this review,
I can provide advice on how to use Azure DevOps more effectively. I can also
help implement the recommended improvements.

## Kickstart DevOps

With Kickstart DevOps, I assist your team in getting started with your DevOps
transition. We will align your needs, but a Kickstart DevOps typically includes
the following:

- Assessment of the current situation
- Development of an improvement plan
- Setup of basic CI/CD pipelines and reusable templates
- Training for the team

## Continuous Improvement

The Continuous Improvement package can be a follow-up to the DevOps Kickstart.
I will assess the current setup of your CI/CD pipelines and periodically look
for bottlenecks. I will then adjust the pipelines accordingly.

Additionally, I am available for advice and support to handle any ad-hoc issues
or questions.

- Monthly check-ins and optimizations
- Performance monitoring and adjustments of CI/CD pipelines
- On-demand advice and support

## Advanced DevOps Transformation

With Advanced DevOps Transformation, I dive deeper into your environment.
Some components that may be included in this package are:

- In-depth assessment and roadmap creation
- Implementation of advanced DevOps tools and practices
- Integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automation
- Extensive training and workshops for the team

## DevOps as a Service

For smaller organizations that may not have the resources for a full-time
DevOps engineer, I offer my services as a part-time DevOps platform engineer.
This flexible approach allows organizations to benefit from expert guidance
without the commitment of a full-time hire. I can help set up and maintain a
DevOps platform tailored to your specific needs and goals.

For questions, [contact me](mailto:info@mikebeemsterboer.nl).

## Training

In addition to supporting DevOps tools, I also offer training. This can be
on DevOps itself or on specific tools. For example, I provide Azure DevOps
training, not just for managing Azure DevOps, but also for users. I can create
custom training for almost any topic related to DevOps and Azure DevOps.
