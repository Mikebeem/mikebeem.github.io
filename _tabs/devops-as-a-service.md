## DevOps as a Service

Do you want your DevOps platform to run smoothly without hiring a full-time
Platform Engineer? With DevOps as a Service, you gain access to an experienced
DevOps expert who supports your team as needed ‚Äî from setting up CI/CD
pipelines to improving workflows and automating security checks.

### How does it work?

We start with an initial meeting to discuss your team's needs. Based on that,
we create a flexible subscription tailored to your situation. This can include:

- **Setup and maintenance** of Azure DevOps, GitHub, or GitLab.
- **Optimization of CI/CD pipelines** for one or multiple projects.
- **Automation of workflows** to eliminate repetitive tasks.
- **Security checks and reporting** using tools like SonarCloud and GitLeaks.

You decide how often you need my expertise:

- **A few hours per month** for advice and maintenance.
- **More regular support** for structural improvement.

### Why choose DevOps as a Service?

- **No hassle with maintenance** ‚Äî Your tools will keep running smoothly.
- **Always up-to-date workflows** ‚Äî I ensure continuously improved pipelines.
- **Flexible support** ‚Äî Scale my involvement to match your needs.

### Customized collaboration

Every organization is different. That‚Äôs why my service is flexible and tailored
to your needs. Instead of offering fixed packages, I act as a strategic partner
helping your team continuously improve your DevOps platform. Together, we
determine what kind of support best fits your organization.

ü§ù **Let‚Äôs get to know each other**

In a no-obligation meeting, we‚Äôll discuss your situation and needs. Together,
we‚Äôll determine how I can best support your organization.
