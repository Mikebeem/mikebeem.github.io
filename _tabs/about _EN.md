## Mike Beemsterboer - DevOps Consultant

As a DevOps Consultant, I focus on improving the processes and collaboration of
IT teams involved in software development and operations. I help organizations
apply Continuous Delivery to deliver software of better quality, with greater
efficiency, and in a way that engineers enjoy more.

[My resume can be found here](/about/resume).

Continuous Delivery and DevOps go beyond just automation and setting up tools.
Itâ€™s about addressing the entire process, from the idea, to developing software,
deploying it to production, maintaining it in production, continuously gathering
feedback, and ultimately decommissioning the application. But in the end, it's
mostly about mindset: continuously wanting to improve, as an individual, as a
team, and as an organization. To keep learning and always striving to improve.

Over the past years, I have worked in this role for several organizations.
First at Vivat (now Athora), a large Dutch insurance company, then on behalf of
Delta-N at various organizations, including CAK, DLL Group, and De Nederlandsche
Bank (DNB), and currently I am carrying out an assignment at Delta Fiber Nederland.

Are you also looking for someone to help your organization with this?
