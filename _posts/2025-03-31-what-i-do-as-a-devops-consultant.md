As a DevOps Consultant, I help organizations optimize their software development and IT processes. My focus is on improving collaboration, automation, and efficiency within teams.

Here are some ways I add value:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Designing, implementing, and optimizing continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Setting up infrastructure using tools like Azure Bicep or Terraform.
- **Automation**: Writing scripts and tools to automate repetitive tasks.
- **DevOps Strategy**: Developing a roadmap to implement or enhance DevOps practices.
- **Training and Coaching**: Guiding teams in adopting DevOps culture and tools.

My goal is to help organizations deliver software faster, more reliably, and more efficiently.
