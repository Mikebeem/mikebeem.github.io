With my experience as a DevOps Consultant, I am eager to help various organizations
improve their DevOps practices and workflows. To help as many organizations as possible,
I have outlined some example projects on my website. These serve as examples to
show how I can assist your organization.

Here are some examples:

- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: setting up and improving pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: creating and writing Azure Bicep templates.
- **Automation**: writing scripts to automate builds, deployments, or other
  repetitive tasks.
- **Kickstart DevOps**: helping you get started with DevOps practices.
- **Continuous Improvement**: a follow-up to the kickstart or available as a
  standalone service. A longer-term collaboration focused on continuous improvement.
- **Advanced DevOps Transformation**: a more intensive collaboration.
